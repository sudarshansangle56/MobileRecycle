           <h1>How We Work</h1>
        <p>Our platform, E-Waste Guardian, simplifies and secures electronic waste recycling by directly connecting users with authorized recycling companies. Users can register their unused or damaged electronic devices on the platform, ensuring proper disposal without intermediaries like scrap dealers. The system prioritizes data security by securely erasing sensitive information before recycling. Additionally, users receive a detailed report on material recovery, ensuring transparency. Valuable materials like gold, silver, and copper are extracted and reused, while other components are recycled into new products. This initiative promotes sustainability, reduces e-waste, and prevents resource wastage.</p>
