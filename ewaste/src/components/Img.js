        <h1>How We Work</h1>
        <p>We make e-waste recycling simple and secure. Submit your old or damaged device, and get an instant evaluation. To protect your privacy, we ensure complete data wiping before recycling. Once picked up, you can track your device in real-time until it reaches a certified recycler. Valuable materials like gold, copper, and silver are recovered for reuse, while non-recyclable parts are safely disposed of. Our process ensures hassle-free recycling, promotes sustainability, and helps reduce e-waste pollution.
